# Enhanced Super Resolution GAN (ESRGAN) Implementation

## Welcome!

Welcome to the ESRGAN Implementation repository! This project implements the Enhanced Super Resolution GAN (ESRGAN). Credits for the original projects go to:

- [BasicSR](https://github.com/xinntao/BasicSR)
- [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN)
- [ESRGAN Documentation](https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN)

This implementation focuses specifically on ESRGAN, providing an easy-to-use tool for enhancing image resolution.

## How to Use

### Steps:

1. **Download Model and Code:**
    - Begin by downloading the model and codes from [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l0gBRMqhVLpL_-7R7aN-q-3hnv5ADFSM/view?usp=sharing).
    (Note: The model 'models/RRDB_ESRGAN_x4.pth' is already uploaded in this implementation)

2. **Prepare LR Input Images:**
    - Once downloaded, place your low-resolution (LR) input images in the `LR` folder.

3. **Run the Code:**
    - Execute `python test.py` to start the enhancement process.

4. **View Output:**
    - Explore the result folder to view the enhanced output images.
